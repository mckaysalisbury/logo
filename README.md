I've been reading [Secret Coders](https://amzn.to/2ZwGvCw) with my sons, and they gave me an
assignment to draw a face. My youngest drew a picture, and while my program is not perfectly
faithful, it's close enough to get a pass from him.

I'd love to use parameters and variables, but they haven't learned those yet, just repeats.
